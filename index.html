        <p>
          A college student excited to leave the arching confines of the school
           system and start a life.  As a lifelong resident of Pittsburgh, I
            have spent my whole life here including going to college.
            My 30 second elevator speech is that I am a student here at the
            University of Pittsburgh, majoring in Mathematical Biology and
            Computer Science.  Interested in pursuing a career in the database
            field. I am a creative and problem solving soul and would like to
            work somewhere that is both challenging and interesting.  Hopefully
            my career path takes me down roads that allow me to move around
            and see new perspectives everywhere.

        One of my favorite things in life is Dance.  I have been Irish dancing
        since I was 4 years’ old. I grew up in the Irish dance culture, and
        have participated in shows, competitions and group dances.  Throughout
         the years I have tried a variety of other dance styles including ballet
        and swing.  Any kind of dance is great as long as it keeps you moving
         and entertained.

        <h2 class="header">Photography </h2>
        <p>
          My photography career started off when my grandfather gave me and my
           sister polaroid cameras.  It was such a fun hobby that when digital
           camera came out I was the first one in the house to have one. Since
           then I have had a few more cameras and have taken a lot more photos.
            My photos my not always have the most interesting of subjects, but
            I think that it’s all in the angle. In my photos I often go for
            flair or intrigue but sometimes just a pretty photo will do.
