 One of my favorite things in life is Dance.  I have been Irish dancing
 since I was 4 yearsâ€™ old. I grew up in the Irish dance culture, and
 have participated in shows, competitions and group dances.  Throughout
 the years I have tried a variety of other dance styles including ballet
 and swing.  Any kind of dance is great as long as it keeps you moving
 and entertained.
