<?php echo "A college student excited to leave the arching confines of the school
           system and start a life.  As a lifelong resident of Pittsburgh, I
            have spent my whole life here including going to college.
            My 30 second elevator speech is that I am a student here at the
            University of Pittsburgh, majoring in Mathematical Biology and
            Computer Science.  Interested in pursuing a career in the database
            field. I am a creative and problem solving soul and would like to
            work somewhere that is both challenging and interesting.  Hopefully
            my career path takes me down roads that allow me to move around
            and see new perspectives everywhere."
