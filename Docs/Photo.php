My photography career started off when my grandfather gave me and my
sister polaroid cameras.  It was such a fun hobby that when digital
camera came out I was the first one in the house to have one. Since
then I have had a few more cameras and have taken a lot more photos.
My photos my not always have the most interesting of subjects, b
I think that itâ€™s all in the angle. In my photos I often go for
flair or intrigue but sometimes just a pretty photo will do.
